        <p> My hobby is swimming.The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed. On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat.<br> <br>
            It’s amazing pushing yourself to the challenge of beating someone else to the finish line and it’s great fun racing across the pool as fast as you can! Trying little tricks like underwater handstands and flips also puts a big smile on my face.

            Another reason that I love swimming is that it has more variety than other sports. Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesn’t feel like you’re stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Adding swimming equipment like flippers, a snorkel or a noodle (a flexible cylindrical piece of foam) changes the experience yet again and can help you develop your swimming technique.</p>
